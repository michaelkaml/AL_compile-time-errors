## ALTester
* Adds the same random number (from 0 to 100) to both arrTheFuchs(ArrayList<Integer>) and michealKaml(OrderedArrayList) for a total of 23 times. Then it loops through arrTheFuchs and checks if it is in ascending order. Then it does the same for michealKaml.

## OrderedArrayList
### Methods Offered:
* toString : uses the built in toString method of ArrayList, thus returns _data.toString().

* remove : uses the built in remove(int) method for ArrayList.

* size : uses the built in size() method for an ArrayList, thus returns _data.size(). 

* get : uses the built in get(int) method of an ArrayList, thus returns _data.get(index)

* addLinear : goes through _data until it finds a value that is greater than or equal to newValue, then it inputs newValue at the index using built in add(int, int) method for an ArrayList.

* addBinary : incomplete.
